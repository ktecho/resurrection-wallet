## Installation

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/ktecho/resurrection-wallet/releases/latest) and run it. AppImages are recommended because they'll be easier to update to the next version.

It will prompt you to install Phoenixd automatically. If you already have Phoenixd installed, a new version will be downloaded and installed automatically, but you'll be able to use the same wallet, channels, etc.
